# Tech Test

Your task is to create a React Native application that will consume data from the SpaceX public API. The application must retrieve historic and future SpaceX launches and present them in a list view.
Provided in this pack are a copy of the designs (which are for web, so please interperet them as you wish for mobile) as well as all of the assets you will need. Use the create-react-native-app CLI tool to generate a new project and feel free to use any 3rd party packages that will assist in your development.

Designs are available from: [https://www.sketch.com/s/09d14b3c-a48c-478a-9d4e-94cf16d6d67f/a/zx7v7Kb](https://www.sketch.com/s/09d14b3c-a48c-478a-9d4e-94cf16d6d67f/a/zx7v7Kb)

The API documentation is available from:
Postman - [https://docs.spacexdata.com](https://docs.spacexdata.com/)
GitHub - [https://github.com/r-spacex/SpaceX-API](https://github.com/r-spacex/SpaceX-API)

We advise using the V3 API as even though it is depracted, as the designs are based off the responses returned in that version.

## Stories:

- As a user, I want the ability to load the full list of SpaceX launches from the SpaceX API
- As a user, I want the ability to reload the data to see any new changes
- As a user, I want the ability to filter the launch list by year
- As a user, I want the ability to sort all launches by date (ascending/descending)

## Considerations we will be looking for in your submission are:

- Project approach
- Accuracy of designs (within reason as they are not catered for mobile)
- State management (Redux / Context etc...)
- Code quality (e.g patterns and organisation of the application code)
- Network logic
- File structure

## Bonus Considerations:

- Type Safety i.e TypeScript
- Unit Tests
- Accessibility considerations

Please complete the task using a Git source control tool such as GitHub or Bitbucket. Remember to commit your code regularly, and as your submission, please provide access.

We advise spending no more than 2 hours coming up with your solution. Don't worry though, you are not expected to complete all of the tasks within this period, so just try your best and see how far you get!

Feel free to detail any extra considerations / areas for improvement at the bottom of this file.
